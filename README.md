- # Lab 1 - Done

Translated programming language:    Java
Instrumental programming language:  C++

- # Lab 2 - Lexical Analyser

```
The main task purpose is to create a program using C++ 
to translate Java program (input.java) to stream of lexeme (tokens).
Finally we get a lexical analyser, that group program code and separate it to following groups:
- Key words
- Operators
- Variables (names)
- Variables types
- Constants

If program has an undefined 'token', it will be added to errors table.

Current stage: Done.

#
- # Lab 3 - Syntax Analyser

```
Here we will create an abstract syntax tree to check our tokens stream to compliance with syntactic norms.
Our token expressions will be grouped into grammatical phrases.

Current stage: Started (10%)
